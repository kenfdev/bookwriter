# Bookwriter

Bookwriter is a writing application for one long book. The book is a folder of Markdown files. You write each piece on its own, arrange the pieces in an outline, and export one manuscript or a PDF.

The rules of the manuscript live in `bookwriter-spec.md`. This file is how you run the program and how a book is laid out on disk.

## Usage

Install once, from this directory:

```
npm install
```

Then:

```
Usage:
  bw <directory>
  bw --help

Build Bookwriter and open the book in <directory>.
The directory must already exist. A folder with no manuscript yet becomes an empty book.

bookwriter <directory> opens that book without rebuilding.
bookwriter --help prints this usage.
With no directory, bookwriter opens spec-book/.
```

`bw --help` and `bookwriter --help` print that usage and exit. `bw` with no directory, or with a path that is not a directory, prints the same usage and exits with status 64. `bw` opens the book from a Bookwriter app bundle, so the Dock and the app switcher show the book icon.

Inside the window:

- **File → Open Book** (⌘O) opens another folder. **Export Manuscript** (⌘⇧E) writes one Markdown file. **Export PDF** writes a PDF. The PDF prints the front matter's notes at the end of the front matter and each chapter's notes at the end of that chapter. **Export Chapters to Word** writes each front-matter piece as `FM-title.docx` and each chapter as `cc-title.docx` into one directory.
- The outline is the book. Drag a row to reorder it, or drop it on a folder to nest it. The form under the outline edits the title, synopsis, status, role, and unit. The book title is the field at the top of the window.
- A section opens in the Markdown editor. A folder opens as a reading view of that folder, in tree order.
- **Markup** shows or hides the preview beside the editor. The preview follows the buffer, including unsaved text. Clicking in the Markdown scrolls the preview to that place.
- **Find** (⌘F) searches the open text. The find panel has a whole-book checkbox. Find Next is ⌘G.
- **Command Palette** (⌘K) inserts emphasis, strong, inline code, a link, a picture, a heading, a list, a quotation, a code block, or a footnote. The Markup page lists the same commands.
- A footnote marker in the preview scrolls to that note, and the return mark scrolls back. When the Markdown is on screen, the cursor moves to that same place.

## A book on disk

```text
my-book/
  book.yaml
  images/
    bridge.jpg
  manuscript/
    010-front-matter/
      _index.md
      010-preface.md
    020-naming/
      _index.md
      010-the-rule/
        _index.md
        010-inward.md
    trash/
      _index.md
```

`book.yaml` holds the title.

```yaml
title: The Book Title
```

Under `manuscript/`:

- A directory is a folder of pieces. `_index.md` inside it is that folder's own prose. The body may be empty.
- Any other `.md` file is a section.
- `trash/` holds deleted pieces. Empty trash removes those pieces and leaves the folder. Export and the reading view skip it.
- Sibling order is the numeric prefix: `010`, `020`, `030`. The words after the prefix are a name taken from the title when the piece is created. Renaming the title does not rename the file. Dragging rewrites the prefixes in that directory.
- Pictures live in `images/`. A picture in the text is a path from the book folder, such as `images/bridge.jpg`.

Each Markdown file starts with a header the application owns. The body after the header is yours, and it is written back as the editor holds it.

```markdown
---
id: inward
title: Inward
synopsis: Source dependencies point inward, toward policy.
status: draft
role: body
unit: text
---
A dependency points inward.[^1]

# Where the rule stops

[^1]: Toward higher-level policy.
```

`id` stays put for the life of the piece. `status` is `idea`, `draft`, `revise`, or `done`. `role` is `front` or `body`. Front matter is not numbered. `unit` is `part`, `chapter`, `section`, or `text`. A part or a chapter is numbered, and a part, a chapter, or a section starts on a new page. Text stays on the current page. The numbers are computed from the tree. They are not stored in the file.

The body is Pandoc Markdown. A heading in the body is a subsection, written with `#`. A footnote is `[^1]` with `[^1]: …` in the same file, or an inline `^[…]`. Labels are local to that file.
